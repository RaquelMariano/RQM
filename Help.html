        <h2> About the Responsive Building Envelope Solutions (RBES) Database Application </h2>
      
This application was developed in the context of a dissertation for obtaining the Master of Science Degree in Civil Engineering in Instituto Superior Técnico.
The work focuses on responsive solutions applied in envelopes of buildings all over the world.
A RBES can be defined as a solution applied in the envelope of a building which displays a dynamic response to indoor and/or outdoor conditions and/or 
to the occupants preferences, which are implemented with the main goal of improving indoor comfort and saving energy in buildings.
The dissertation can be consulted for deeper understanding of the present database and referenced as:

        <h2> How to use this application </h2>
      
To view the complete tables that constitute the database simply click on the links below the "Database Tables" title. 
Each table holds information about a specific entity.
        
<p>-> Building Table - Holds information regarding every building, namely the building's name, a picture, location, designers, and more.</p>
<p>-> Application Table - Holds information regarding every RBES application on a given building, namely where in the building's envelope the RBES is located, its orientation, control type, mechanism, and more.</p>
<p>-> Solutions Table - Holds a short description of each type of responsive solution.</p>
<p>-> Double-Skin Façades Table - Holds information regarding characterization of every double-skin façade application, namely the ventilation type, ventilation mode, cavity partition, input, output and more.</p>
<p>-> Openings Table - Holds information regarding characterization of every opening application, namely the type, input, output, user override and more. </p>
<p>-> Shading Systems Table - Holds information regarding characterization of every shading system application, namely type, opacity, input and more.</p>
<p>-> Kinetic Envelopes Table - Holds information regarding characterization of every kinetic envelope application, namely scale, motion, input and more.</p>
<p>-> Smart Materials Table - Holds information regarding characterization of every smart material application, namely type, subtype, input and more.</p>
<p>-> Green Systems Table - Holds information regarding characterization of every green system application, namely type and plants.</p>

</p>In order to demonstrate that the information in these tables can be easily filtered and researched in ways that are useful to the information consumers, some possible interactions were programmed.</p>
