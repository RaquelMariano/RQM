        <h2> About the Responsive Building Envelope Solutions (RBES) Database Application </h2>
      
This application was developed in the context of a dissertation written by Raquel Mariano for obtaining the Master of Science Degree in Civil Engineering in Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, supervised by Prof. Maria da Glória de Almeida Gomes and Professor Francisco Afonso Severino Regateiro.
The work focuses on responsive solutions applied in envelopes of buildings all over the world.
A RBES can be defined as a solution applied in the envelope of a building which displays a dynamic response to indoor and/or outdoor conditions and/or 
to the occupants preferences, and which is implemented with the main goal of improving indoor comfort and saving energy in buildings.
The dissertation can be consulted for deeper understanding of the present database in https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/mec/dissertacoes and referenced as:

        <h2> How to use this application </h2>
      
To view the complete tables that constitute the database simply click on the links below the "Database Tables" title. 
Each table holds information about a specific entity.
        
        <p>-> <b>Building Table </b>- Holds information regarding every building, namely the building's name, a picture, location, designers, and more.</p>
<p>-> <b>Application Table </b>- Holds information regarding every RBES application on a given building, namely where in the building's envelope the RBES is located, its orientation, control type, mechanism, and more.</p>
<p>-> <b>Solutions Table</b> - Holds a short description of each type of responsive solution.</p>
<p>-> <b>Double-Skin Façades Table</b> - Holds information regarding characterization of every double-skin façade application, namely the ventilation type, ventilation mode, cavity partition, input, output and more.</p>
<p>-> <b>Openings Table </b>- Holds information regarding characterization of every opening application, namely the type, input, output, user override and more. </p>
<p>-> <b>Shading Systems Table</b> - Holds information regarding characterization of every shading system application, namely type, opacity, input and more.</p>
<p>-> <b>Kinetic Envelopes Table</b> - Holds information regarding characterization of every kinetic envelope application, namely scale, motion, input and more.</p>
<p>-> <b>Smart Materials Table </b>- Holds information regarding characterization of every smart material application, namely type, subtype, input and more.</p>
<p>-> <b>Green Systems Table </b>- Holds information regarding characterization of every green system application, namely type and plants.</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate that the information in these tables can be easily filtered and researched in ways that are useful to the information consumers, some possible interactions were programmed.</p>
<p>In the link <b> Building Table - Search for Country </b> it is possible to filter the <b>Building Table</b> by a given country by writing the name of that country in the search box and clicking the button "search".</p>        
<p>In the link <b> Application Table - Search for Type of Responsive Solution </b> it is possible to filter the <b>Application Table</b> by a given type of RBES by writing the name of that solution in the search box and clicking the button "search". The options available are <b> DSF </b>,<b> Opening </b>,<b> Shading System </b>,<b> Kinetic Envelope </b>,<b> Smart Material </b> and <b> Green System </b>.</p>
<p>In the link <b> Responsive Solution Tables - Search for Building ID </b> it is possible to filter any of the tables of specific RBES by a given Building ID by writing that ID in the search box and clicking the button "search".</p>     
<p>In the link <b> Map </b> it is possible to view the location of the buildings with RBES on a map and filter that map by a given type of RBES by choosing it from the dropdown menu.</p>    
<p>In the link <b> Graphs </b> it is possible to view dynamic charts produced with information from the tables, that are permanently updated as the information in the tables is updated.</p>
